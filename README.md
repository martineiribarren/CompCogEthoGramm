CompCogEthoGramm is a repository for replicating experiments, implementing code, and conducting computational ethological analysis. The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations in ethology and their practical implementation using modern data science and machine learning techniques.

This repository includes:

Reproduction of benchmark experiments

Implementation of behavior classification models

Analysis and visualization tools for ethological data

Theoretical reviews linking ethological traditions with computational approaches.

It is intended as both a research tool and an open framework for those interested in the computational modeling of behavior, biosemiosis, and the interdisciplinary study of animal cognition.
